Task 1:

For the solution of this task was used module statistics
If it is required not to use it it is possible to rewrite the program

Input data: from keyboard

Task 2:

Input data: from keyboard

Here fraction of two input numbers is translated into
numerical system with given base. Then if it is possible 
(in case of periodical decimal fraction) the output 
result is simplified according to the task. 

There is no limitation on sign of input numbers and its type 
(by default it is supposed to be float or integer,
however it would be better to check the input format)

Since the conversion of float part can be infinite,
there is a precision in order to stop computation (here I use 8 digits after comma)

Also it was taken into consideration the representation of 
numbers in numerical systems with bases > than 10, when
there is a necessity to use letters (A, B, ...)
It is easy to see that in this program there is a limit on base (36)
However, it can be increased by addition of new symbols
(for example, we can get them from unicode table)
